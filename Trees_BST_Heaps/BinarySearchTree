A Binary Search Tree is a type of binary tree that satisfies: (This are also properties)

1.Every node has at most two children — left and right.
2.Left subtree values < node’s value
3.Right subtree values > node’s value
4.Both left and right subtrees are also BSTs.

Binary search tree is a data structure that quickly allows us to maintain a sorted list of numbers.
It is called a binary tree because each tree node has a maximum of two children.
It is called a search tree because it can be used to search for the presence of a number in O(log(n)) time.

Example BST :

        50
       /  \
     30    70
    / \    / \
  20  40  60  80


Root = 50
All nodes in the left subtree of 50 have values less than 50.
All nodes in the right subtree of 50 have values greater than 50.
The property repeats for every node.

agar nodes organised hogi toh aap kee node pee naa easily puch sakhte hoo people thats it

in BST the TC is always order of height O(height)

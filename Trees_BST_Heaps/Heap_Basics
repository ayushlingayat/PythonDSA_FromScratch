A Heap is:
A complete binary tree (CBT) — all levels are completely filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.

Satisfies the Heap Property:
Max Heap: Every parent is ≥ its children.
Min Heap: Every parent is ≤ its children.

Heap ≠ Binary Search Tree (BST)
Heap property only cares about parent-child relationship, not about left being smaller or larger.


Types of Heaps

Max Heap : Parent is always greater than or equal to its children.

        100
       /   \
     50     90
    /  \   /  \
  30   40 80  85


Min Heap : Parent is always less than or equal to its children.

        10
       /  \
     15    20
    / \    / \
  30  40  50  60


Insertion and deletion in Heap is O(log n)

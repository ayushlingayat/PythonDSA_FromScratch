#Types of Binary Tree

1. Full Binary Tree
-> Every node has 0 or 2 children (no node has only one child).

          1
        /   \
       2     3
      / \   / \
     4   5 6   7

2.Perfect Binary Tree
All internal nodes have 2 children
All leaf nodes are at the same level

ismein bhi 0 yaa phir 2 children hoo sakhte hee

          1
        /   \
       2     3
      / \   / \
     4   5 6   7

3.Complete Binary Tree
All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level
Last level is filled from left to right

no of child pee restriction nhi hota hee child can be 0,1,2
bhi hoo sakhte hee okk

complete binary tree yeeh bolta hee kii agar mein yeeh tree
mein level by level traverse karta huu toh ismein
koi bhi gap nhi anna chahiye until and unless pura tree
traverse naa hoo jaye

          1
        /   \
       2     3
      / \   /
     4   5 6

4. Degenerate (or Skewed) Binary Tree
Every parent node has only one child.
Can be left-skewed or right-skewed.

degenerate binary tree mein 0 yaa phir bss 1 children hoga litreally
aesha hee hota hee yeeh

skewed matlab ek direction
yaa toh right mein sarre node nhi toh left mein sarre node

Left Skewed
    1
   /
  2
 /
3


Right Skewed
1
 \
  2
   \
    3

4. Balanced Binary Tree
Height difference between left and right subtree is not
more than 1 for any node.

joo node hoti naa uska left subtree aur uska naa right subtree
unki height kaa joo difference hota hee vooh 1 yaa phir 1 seeh chota hota hee

 abs(h(left_subtree) - h(right_subtree)) <= 1 (or zero)

agar 1 seeh bada hua toh vooh balanced binary tree nhi hee

A Balanced Binary Tree is a binary tree in which the height difference
between the left and right subtree of every node is at most 1.
ðŸ“Œ It ensures good performance (O(log n) for insert/search/delete).

        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5

Node 1: left height = 2 (via node 2), right height = 1 â†’ difference = 1 âœ…
Node 2: left height = 1 (via node 4), right height = 1 (via node 5) â†’ difference = 0 âœ…
All nodes are balanced âœ…
This is a valid Balanced Binary Tree.

yaha pee log of base 2 n hota hee tree kee height yeeh property hee okk

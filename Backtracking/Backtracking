ðŸŒ€ Backtracking (Simple Definition)

Backtracking is a problem-solving technique where we build a solution step by step
and undo (backtrack) a step if it leads to a wrong path.

Think of it like exploring a maze:
Move forward if possible
If you hit a dead end, go back (backtrack) and try a different path

Itâ€™s mainly used in recursion problems involving choices
(pick or not pick, place or not place).

ðŸŒ€ Where Backtracking is Used?

Combinations (choose items, order doesnâ€™t matter)

Permutations (arrange items, order matters)

Problems like: N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Word Search, Rat in a Maze, Subsets, etc.

ðŸŽ¯ Combinations vs Permutations

Combination: Order does NOT matter.
Example: Choose 2 numbers from [1,2,3] â†’ [1,2], [1,3], [2,3]

Permutation: Order DOES matter.
Example: Arrange 2 numbers from [1,2,3] â†’ [1,2], [2,1], [1,3], [3,1], [2,3], [3,2]
